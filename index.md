## Introduction

I am 38 and prior military of 10yr the last 4 of which were as a network tech, which led me to my current job as a network engineer. As of this writing this is my first year ever in a college setting which has been quite a culture shock. The collection of experience levels throughout all my classes has been vast my current course load has challenging courses.

Prior to my military experience I had been building PC’s and networks as a side job to my construction field. I attended a 1yr military course on network admin/maintenance which lead to me co-designing a communication building and maintenance procedures. This led to a job offer upon my exit from the military where I am part of a 2-man team designing a communications contingent site from the ground up.

I am the proud caretake of a boxer/terrior mix named Spazz who is the single most important thing in my life. I have traveled all over the world with him and have a tattoo from every place I have been.

### Course Expectations

My decision to enroll in a Python course was completely due to the needed units for my degree.

The following items could be factors that would lead to me not doing well in the class:
  1.	My lack of experience with any form of coding
  2.	Lack of very well-defined structure from one point to another in the class ie: we do this for this reason and this for this reason
  3.	To many group projects – I am still learning how to re-integrate with people and being forced into to many group setting will actually cause me to recoil away.
  4.	I am an extremely straightforward thinking individual which makes coming up with ideas that are not based on a given work topic or given work documentations is virtually impossible for me. IE: I have no imagination at all. If asked a question or told to do something I answer as directly as possible and I do exactly what was ask down to every detail with no deviations.
